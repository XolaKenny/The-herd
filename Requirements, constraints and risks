Requirements
1. Localization: A variety of regional languages and dialects must be supported by the AI system.
2. The AI system should support continuous learning from new data to improve its accuracy.
3. Data Privacy and Security: Ensuring the protection of users' personal health data in compliance with relevant regulations.
4. The AI system must be able to process and analyze data in real-time to provide fast and accurate information.
5. It should fit into existing QAQC-systems (quality assurance and quality control).


Constraints 
1. Infrastructure Limitations: In rural areas, there is a limited penetration of smartphones and internet connectivity.
2. Incomplete information can lead to misunderstanding.
3. AI algorithms with high-quality and diverse datasets is required to learn and make accurate predictions.
4. Ethical and Legal Issues: There are ethical concerns about AI's impact on patient autonomy, informed consent, and confidentiality.
5. Regulatory and Policy Gaps: Existing regulations and policies may not fully address the complexities of AI in healthcare.

Risks
1. Data privacy concerns, potential biases in the AI model, and the reliability of the AI tool in diverse real-world scenarios.
2. The AI chatbot might provide incorrect or unsafe recommendations due to errors in data processing.
3. Reluctance to adopt new technology because of mistrust or a lack of digital literacy is known as adoption resistance.
4. Bias and inequality. There are risks involving bias and inequality in health-care AI. AI systems learn from the data on which they are trained, and they can incorporate biases from those data.
