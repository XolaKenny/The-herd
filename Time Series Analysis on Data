Time Series Analysis on Data:


Time series analysis will be applied to monitor changes in health outcomes over time. This analysis will involve collecting
and analysing data on healthcare-related events, such as the prevalence of certain diseases or the frequency of specific
symptoms over time.

Additionally, time series data on user engagement and health literacy levels will be used to assess the long-term impact 
of the AI solution. This will allow for the identification of seasonal or periodic trends in health behaviours,
enabling proactive adjustments to the educational content.

Also ensuring that the information provided by the application is not only accurate but also contextually relevant,
enhancing its effectiveness in improving public health outcomes.
