Natural Language Processing (NLP), Speech Recognition, or Speech Synthesis:

NLP and speech recognition are very important for making the AI-powered chatbot useful for healthcare education in rural South Africa.
These tools help break down communication barriers, allowing the platform to work well for people who speak different languages or dialects,
especially in areas where there are many local languages.

Relevance to the Project: The chatbot helps people get better healthcare information, which fits with the 4th Industrial Revolution's goal
of using technology like AI to improve healthcare access. NLP helps the chatbot understand and respond to user questions in a natural way, 
making sure the information is clear and useful for each person's needs. 
This is essential for improving health knowledge and fairness in areas where people may not have easy access to healthcare.

Speech Recognition and Synthesis: These features allow people to talk to the chatbot using their voice, which is helpful for people who may 
not be able to read or write well. The chatbot can also speak back to them, giving them the information they need in an easy-to-understand 
way. This makes it accessible for more people, especially those in rural areas.

How It Can Be Achieved: Using existing tools like Google’s TensorFlow, Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services, or OpenAI’s models, this technology
can be built to support many South African languages. These tools are already able to handle different languages and can be customized for 
local needs. With cloud computing, the system can scale up and handle lots of users while adapting to new health trends.

This setup will continue to improve as more people use it, ensuring it stays up-to-date and useful for the community's changing needs.
